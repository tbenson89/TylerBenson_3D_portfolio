# My Software Developer Portfolio

This site is built using vite + react + three.js animations

` npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react `

## Setup/Run

Run `npm install` && `npm run dev`

## Note

We have fixed the npm install -- dependency issues. we removed react-tilt and are using react-parallax-tilt instead!
ALso look into other versions using VITE :)
